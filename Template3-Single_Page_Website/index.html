        <h2>Krivina<h2>
        <h3>2012, 70 Minutes, HDCAM</h3>
        <p>Miro, an immigrant from the former Yugoslavia lives in Toronto. When he finds out that his pre-war friend Dado, who has been missing for almost two decades, is now wanted for war-era crimes, his life starts to unravel. Upon hearing that Dado still visits a village on the outskirts of Sarajevo, Miro embarks on a trip back to Bosnia to find his friend.
        <br>  
        Director's Note: During my film studies, I wanted to make a film that could capture a feeling of loss, coupled with the inability to move on with one’s life. This was a feeling that resonated with me and many other people who emigrated to the West from former Yugoslavia as a result of the war.<a href="#">[more info]</a></p>

        <h2>The Fuse: Or How I Burned Simon Bolivar</h2>
        <h3>Original title: Kako Sam Zapalio Simona Bolivara</h3>
        <h3>2011, 9 Minutes, HDCAM</h3>
        <p>Using personal home video footage, this documentary follows how a young boy’s attempts to avoid a poor mark on a school assignment in 1990’s Sarajevo, may have contributed to a civil war.
        <br>
        Director’s Note: The Fuse is a story of childhood naïveté, and of those moments, in this case rather ominous ones, which inevitably teach a child that he is not the center of the universe. In the Fuse, I wanted to explore the universality of this feeling, albeit within the very specific and traumatic context of the Bosnian civil war. Sensing that everything is about to change, the nine-year-old boy, Igor, appears even slightly excited, being oblivious to the chaos that was about to engulf Sarajevo.</p>
